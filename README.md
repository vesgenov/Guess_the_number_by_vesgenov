# Guess_the_number_by_vesgenov
This is a simple game as a project task. 

Done by me, the goal of this project is a personal one - to train writing code and working with Github.

The game is realised in a python file and is a console game.

Has 4 difficulties:
    Easy (unlimited attempts to guess the number) n\ 
    Novice (15 attempts to guess the number) n\
    Medium (10 attempts to guess the number) n\
    Hard (5 attempts to guess the number) n\
    
No functions involved, just pure basic if/else logic in a while loop.
